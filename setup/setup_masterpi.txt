# Setup your Master Services PI
# Should not be part of the docker stack; but should run DB, NFS, etc shared
# Services
# Recommend using an SSD and Swap to speed up

# Setup MySQL
sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server
# Set MySQL to be accessible from remote hosts
# edit /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf 
#     change bind-address = 127.0.0.1 to #bind-address = 127.0.0.1 (comment out)
# 
# login to Mysql and create a user with all privileges
sudo mysql -uroot -p
# grant all privileges on *.* to 'root'@'%' identified by 'password';
# flush privileges;
# exit
sudo systemctl stop mariadb
sudo systemctl start mariadb


# Setup NFS
sudo mkdir -p /opt/nfs
sudo chown nobody:nogroup /opt/nfs
sudo chmod 755 /opt/nfs
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server nfs-common rpcbind -y
# add your export info to the end of /etc/exports
sudo echo "/opt/nfs *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)" >> /etc/exports
# export config, enable services on boot and start NFS
sudo exportfs -ra
sudo systemctl enable rpcbind
sudo systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server
sudo systemctl unmask nfs-common
sudo systemctl enable nfs-common
sudo systemctl start rpcbind
sudo systemctl start nfs-kernel-server
sudo systemctl start nfs-common
# note sometimes you'll get a service that can't be unmasked
#  if that's the case go into /lib/systemd/system and find the service that
#  won't unmask.  It's usually a ln to /dev/null; just rm it and then
#  Run the unmask, enable and start command in that order
